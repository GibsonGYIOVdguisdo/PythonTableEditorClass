# UpdatingCSVtable
This is a python program that allows you to edit a CSV table from within python without using imports.
This program achieves it by first reading the csv file and loading it as a dictionary and updating it with every interaction.

This program is nowhere near good in its current state and has various problems such as requiring a uid to work at all.

If you would like to help out pull requests and issues are welcome!
